SUMMARY="skalibs is a package containing general-purpose libraries"
DESCRIPTION="
skalibs is a package centralizing the free software / open source C development files used for
building all software at skarnet.org: it contains essentially general-purpose libraries. You will
need to install skalibs if you plan to build skarnet.org software. The point is that you won't have
to download and compile big libraries everytime you need to build a package: do it only once.

skalibs can also be used as a sound basic start for C development. There are a lot of
general-purpose libraries out there; but if your main goal is to produce small and secure C code,
you will like skalibs.
