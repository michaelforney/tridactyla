SUMMARY="libFirm provides intermediate representation, optimizations, and code generation suitable for use in compilers"
DESCRIPTION="
libFirm is a C library implementing the Firm low-level intermediate representation. Firm is used to
represent a computer program in order to analyse and transform it. Its main application is compiler
construction where we use it to represent, optimize and transform C and Java programs to native
machine code.

The most important features of Firm are that it is

    * low-level which means that the representation of the program is closer to machine code than to
      the language.
    * completely graph based which means that there are no instruction lists or triple code, only
      data dependence and control flow graphs.
    * completely SSA based which means that the code of the program is always in SSA form.
