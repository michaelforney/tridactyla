SUMMARY="execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language"
DESCRIPTION="
execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh ; but its syntax is quite different from
a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text
file; the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.

execline is now as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling,
filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the
shell's syntax, and has no security issues.
